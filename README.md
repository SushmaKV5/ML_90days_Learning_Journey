# 90 Days Machine Learning Challenge

This repository documents my **90-day Machine-Learning learning streak**, where I build small daily projects covering:

- Python for Data Science
- Data Analysis & Visualization
- Machine Learning Algorithms
- Feature Engineering
- NLP & Time Series
- Model Deployment

## Goal
To build consistency, strengthen ML fundamentals, and create a strong project portfolio through daily hands-on implementations.

## Structure
Each day contains:
- Problem statement
- Dataset
- Implementation notebook/script
- Results & observations

## Progress Tracker

| Month | Focus | Status |
|------|------|------|
| Month 1 | Foundations | In Progress |
| Month 2 | Intermediate ML | Pending |
| Month 3 | Advanced Projects | Pending |

## Tools & Libraries
Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Streamlit, FastAPI
